# API Testing with Postman. First Project
This is a project solely for exploring and learning API testing with Postman API Platform. I have implemented the GET, POST, PATCH, DEL commands to contact with the demo book API.

This project is based on a tutorial by vdespa on the freecodecamp youtube channel
